## Contributing

If you find a bug, feel free to [open a bug at GitHub](https://github.com/DustinHolm/ticit/issues).

Feature requests _can_ be created via [an enhancement](https://github.com/DustinHolm/ticit/issues),
however I will most likely only work on requests that I want to see implemented myself. If you are
able and willing to work on the feature yourself, please note it in the issue.

Code contributions should only be made after I assign you to an issue. Just opening a pull request
(PR) might be ignored. PRs follow [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), although PRs get squashed, so the commit descriptions do not matter as much. Just write a nice PR
title and description.
